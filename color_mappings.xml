<!--
    The Color mappings here define how door colors are assigned from the door editor and from store block values for door blocks.
    
    To add a new color option in the editor, simply copy and paste a color element from below. 
    Make sure to give it a unique id between 1 and 255.
    The id is assigned to the blockvalue and will tell the engine which color to assign
    The name is what will be displayed for the door editor in the 'Preset' Combobox
    The value is just the hex for the color.
    
    The value field can be modified to change the color of any door using its associated id across all POIs.
    
    DON'T CHANGE OR REMOVE THE DEFAULT ELEMENT AS THIS WILL BREAK DOOR COLORS AND THE DOOR EDITOR
